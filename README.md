1.	Install R
I downloaded the free software R from  https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html. I found the link at from https://www.r-project.org/ longer ago. R is a programming language and an environment. From the CRAN homepage you can also download packages.
2.	Install RStudio
To make the work easier with R you can use RStudio. It is a graphical user interface (GUI) with lots of functions. You can write, edit and store code in the upper left window where you can open a script or a markdown tap. In the GUI you can also generate, view and store plots, manage files, objects and dataframes, and integrate with version control systems.
To install the desktop version of it use the page https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Use the free version for your system like Mac or Windows.
